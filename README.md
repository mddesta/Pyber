# Pyber Analysis

## Background 

Analysis of ride sharing mock data that contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

## Technology 

* Jupyter Notebook 
* matplotlib
* Pandas 
* numpy 

## Visualizations

## Conclusions

1. Urban cities have the most number of drivers per city at 80.9%. Urban cities also had highest fare counts as well as total fare amounts compared to both rural and suburban cities.  

2. Even though rural cities had the lowest percentage of rides(5.3% of total), rides taken in these cities had the highest average fare compared to the other city types.  

3. The total fares from of rides taken in a city is positively proportional to the total number of rides. This is true for all city types.
